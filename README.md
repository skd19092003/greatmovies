## üõ°Ô∏è Cloudflare Proxy Solution - Solving ISP Restrictions

### The Problem
Some Internet Service Providers (particularly Jio) block access to TMDB's Website & API domains (api.themoviedb.org and image.tmdb.org). This prevents users on these networks from accessing movie data, making the app unusable.

### The Solution
CineVault implements a **Cloudflare Worker proxy** that acts as an intermediary between the app and TMDB's API:

#### How it Works:
1. **Client Request**: App makes requests to the Cloudflare Worker instead of TMDB directly
2. **Proxy Forward**: Worker receives the request and forwards it to TMDB with your API key
3. **Response Return**: Worker gets TMDB's response and sends it back to your app
4. **Seamless Experience**: Users on restricted networks can now access all movie data

#### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **ISP Bypass**: Circumvents ISP blocks on TMDB domains
- ‚úÖ **Better Performance**: Cloudflare's global CDN provides faster response times
- ‚úÖ **CORS Handling**: Eliminates cross-origin issues
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Fallback**: App falls back to direct TMDB if proxy fails

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19+ with modern hooks and Context API
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for SPA navigation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design and dark/light themes
- **3D Graphics**: OGL library for prismatic effects in Lucky Wheel
- **Icons**: Hero Icons and Font Awesome
- **Deployment**: Vercel with optimized build configuration


## ‚öôÔ∏è Cloudflare Worker Setup (Recommended)

To set up the ISP bypass proxy:

### 1. Create Cloudflare Worker
- Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Workers & Pages
- Click "Create Worker"
- Replace default code with proxy logic

### 2. Add Environment Variables
- In Worker settings ‚Üí Variables ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add `TMDB_API_KEY` with your TMDB API key

### 3. Deploy Worker
- Save and deploy your worker
- Note the worker URL (e.g., `https://your-worker.workers.dev`)

### 4. Configure App
Update your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_TMDB_PROXY_URL=https://your-worker.workers.dev/3
VITE_TMDB_IMAGE_PROXY=https://your-worker.workers.dev/image
```
